\title{Facility for using quoted arguments}
\description{
This package assists with writing functions that automatically quote
their arguments, but that may also wish to evalute them, in their original
environment.  These quoted arguments can be passed to other functions
that quote their arguments, with proper passing of their quoting environment.
It is also possible to set up a variable so that it looks just like
a quoted argument.

In the simplest applications of this package, one can think of calling
\code{quoted_arg(x)} (see below) as altering the default meaning of a
reference to an argument \code{x} from the value of the actual
argument, with the expression passed for \code{x} accessible via
\code{substitute(x)}, so that instead the default is the expression
passed for \code{x}, with the value accessible via
\code{quoted_eval(x)}, as described below.  

However, in more complex applications, the facilities provided by this
package are more than just a convenient change of defaults, as they
allow functions that quote arguments to be combined in ways that would
otherwise be difficult.

\usage{
quoted_arg (...)
quoted_eval (arg)
quoted_environment (arg)
notquoted (x)

quoted_assign (name, value, eval.env, assign.env = parent.frame())
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{names (unquoted) of function arguments that should be quoted}
\item{arg}{the name of a quoted function argument (unquoted)}
\item{x}{any expression.}

\item{name}{the name (as a character string or symbol) of a variable to 
            assign to}
\item{value}{a value to assign to the variable \code{name}}
\item{eval.env}{the environment in which \code{value} may be evaluated;
                may be missing, with default as described below}
\item{assign.env}{the environment in which to assign to \code{name}}
}
\details{
The \code{quoted_arg} function should be called at the start of a
function that uses quoted arguments, with arguments that are the
(unquoted) names of the arguments that should be quoted. After the
call of \code{quoted_arg}, simple references to these arguments will
give the expressions passed as arguments, rather than the values of
these expressions. 

However, the caller of the function can disable this quoting by
passing \code{notquoted(x)} instead of \code{x}, in which case
\code{x} will be evaluated when \code{quoted_arg} is called, and
references to \code{x} will deliver this value, not the expression.

To obtain the value of a quoted argument, \code{quoted_eval} can be
used. The evaluation will be done in the environment of the quoted
expression.  If \code{quoted_eval} is called more than once for the
same argument, the argument will be evaluated that many times
(possibly with different results).  If the actual argument used
\code{notquoted}, \code{quoted_eval} will simply return the
already-evaluated argument.

The environment used by \code{quoted_eval} can be obtained with
\code{quoted_environment}, which will be \code{NULL} if the actual
argument used \code{notquoted}, and may be \code{emptyenv()} if the
expression is self-evaluating, and hence its evaluation would not
reference an environment.

When a quoted argument is passed as an argument to another function
that quotes that argument, the quoted argument received will be the
argument originally passed, not a quoting of the name of the quoted
argument.

A variable can be set up so that it looks like a quoted argument 
using \code{quoted_assign}.  

The name of the variable to set is specified by the \code{name}
argument of \code{quoted_assign}, which must evaluate to a single
character string or a symbol.  The environment in which this variable
is assigned is specified by the \code{assign.env} argument,
which defaults to the current environment (the parent frame of 
\code{quoted_assign}).

The \code{value} argument to \code{quoted_assign} is evaluated to
obtain an expression analogous to an actual argument, which is stored
in the variable specified by \code{name}.  The environment
\code{eval.env} is stored with the assigned expression (in a
``promise''), and will be used when evaluating this expression if
\code{quoted_eval} is called for the assigned variable.  If
\code{eval.env} is missing, it defaults to the current environment,
unless \code{value} is itself a quoted argument, in which case the
default is \code{quoted_environment(value)}.  If the \code{eval.env}
argument of \code{quoted_assign} is \code{NULL}, what is stored in
\code{name} will look like a quoted argument in which the actual
argument used \code{notquoted}, and evaluated to \code{value}, with
the expression stored in the promise being the unevaluated form of
\code{value}.
}
\value{
    \code{quoted_eval} and \code{quoted_environment} return values
    as described above.

    \code{notquoted} returns its argument.

    \code{quoted_arg} and \code{quoted_assign} always return NULL.

    when an argument is not quoted.

    analogous to \code{quoted_assign}.
